    shortDescription: >-
      Web Service specifically designed to expose seismic localization software "hyp2000" and magnitude calculation software "PyML" through APIs
    documentation: 'https://github.com/INGV/apollo/blob/main/README.md'
    longDescription: >
      Apollo is a Web Service developed using Laravel, specifically designed to expose seismic localization software "hyp2000" and magnitude calculation software "PyML" through APIs. 
      It receives an input JSON file (one for each service, 'hyp2000' and 'PyML') containing phases and amplitudes. For each seismic station name it queries metadata, such as latitude and longitude, from the FDSN-StationXML Web Services globally.
      
      The key features of Apollo are its OpenAPI-based development, JSON communication, containerization, and open-source nature.

    features:
      - Web Service built on top of hyp2000 and pyml
      - Software used to locate earthquakes and determine magnitudes in a local or regional seismic network
